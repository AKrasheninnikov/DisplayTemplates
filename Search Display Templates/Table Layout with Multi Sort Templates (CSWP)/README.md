Table Layout with Multi-Sorting Templates (CSWP)
================

With these display templates you are able to render your results in a table layout. You have 10 properties which you could configure, for each managed property the display template will automatically check if it is sortable. If the managed property is sortable, that property retrieves an ascending, descending, and remove sorting link behind it.

In these templates multi-sorting is enabled, which means that you can sort on multiple properties. For example:

1.  Sort on FileExtension
2.  Sort on Author
3.  Sort on size

You are also able with these templates to remove a specific property sorting.

File | Desciption
--- | ---
__Control_List_Table.html__ | This is the control template which needs to be used for the table layout.
__Item_List_Item.html__ | This is the item template which creates a column for each managed property and its value.
