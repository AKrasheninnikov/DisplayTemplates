Getting past the item limit control template (CSWP)
================

By default you can only retrieve a maximum of 50 items with the Content by Search Web Part. By using this display template, you are able to get past this limit and show more than 50 search results.

In the template you can specify your own maximum number of items that may be retrieved. This can be done on line 23: **maxItems**. By default this is set to 175.
