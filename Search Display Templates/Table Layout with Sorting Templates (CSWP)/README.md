Table Layout with Sorting Templates (CSWP)
================

With these display templates you are able to render your results in a table layout. You have 10 properties which you could configure, for each managed property the display template will automatically check if it is sortable. If the managed property is sortable, that property would retrieve an ascending and descending link behind it.

File | Desciption
--- | ---
__Control_List_Table.html__ | This is the control template which needs to be used for the table layout.
__Item_List_Item.html__ | This is the item template which creates a column for each managed property and its value.


**Usage**
These files need to be uploaded to the master page gallery: **http://your-site/_catalogs/masterpage/**.
