#SPCSR Contributors Guidelines
================

The #SPCSR collection of client side rendering functions is a community driven project to create a large repository of the various client side rendering elements that can be used in SharePoint 2013.

Currently there are two repositories.

* Display Templates - This repository contains sub-folders for Search templates and List View (or JSLink) display templates)
* Helper Functions - This repository contains sub-folders for each individual helper function created by the contributor. Helper functions should be able to be used independently of any display template to provide additional functionality.

Each helper function, template or group of templates provided by an author should be contained in it's own folder within the relevant repository. This folder will contain any supporting files, such as .css or images required in the provisioning of the template.

A readme.md file should be created using Markdown language that describes what the template is for and how it should be used. This will then be rendered through the GitHub web interfaces when viewing that folder.

See https://github.com/SPCSR/DisplayTemplates/tree/master/JavaScript%20Display%20Templates%20(JSLink)/Debugging%20ListView%20Template for an example.

You may link to supporting blog posts within this readme.md file.

Many thanks for your support..
