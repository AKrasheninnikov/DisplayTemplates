Sample: Rendering a Whereabouts list
================

This folder contains a sample list view display template that shows how to create a Whereabouts list with modal dialog behaviours as well as custom in line editing using REST.

__csr_ovr_RenderListTemplate.js__             | This template renders a single page of results without any paging ability

__csr_ovr-RenderWhereabouts_ListView.js__     | This template renders a single page of results without any paging ability, styled as the full Whereabouts list view.

__csr_ovr-RenderWhereabouts_ListView2.js__     | This template renders a single page of results without any paging ability, styled as the full Whereabouts list view using REST to post updates back to the list.


This sample was created with a specific set of fields in a custom list in mind:-

__StaffName__ | Contains a single person object
__Monday__ | A single line of text field used to capture the events of the day (limited to 50 characters)

__Tuesday__ | A single line of text field used to capture the events of the day (limited to 50 characters)

__Wednesday__ | A single line of text field used to capture the events of the day (limited to 50 characters)

__Thursday__ | A single line of text field used to capture the events of the day (limited to 50 characters)

__Friday__ | A single line of text field used to capture the events of the day (limited to 50 characters)

__WeekNotes__ | A single line of text field used to capture notes about the week. (Default of 255 characters)

__Choices__ | A single line of text field used to capture the available choices for rendering in the drop down options in edit mode. (Choices seperated by ; (semi-colon))


These samples are from my SharePoint Saturday session of the same name. I'll be recording a video of this in action soon and will link it here.
